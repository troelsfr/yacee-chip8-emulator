# yacee-chip8-emulator
Yet another chip8 emulator

This is a small project to I did to learn about emulators. Chip 8 is a 
fairly easy and forgiving project that can be done in a days time if you
have no idea what you are doing.

The project depends on freeglut but should otherwise be fairly portable. The
project was written using C++11.
